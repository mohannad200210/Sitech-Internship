CI : clone the code package it and test it&#x20;

CD (Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment) : after CI we check that you are authenticated and check the every thing is working then deploy the code ( deliver the code to the system)&#x20;

The key differences between Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment) :&#x20;

Continuous Delivery : After CI there's some magical button that you have to press to deploy the code.&#x20;

Continuous deployment : it's all about just everything is automatic. There's zero human intervention. If code gets pushed at two o'clock in the afternoon to GitHub, guess what? It's going to also be deployed to your system.&#x20;
