## Jenkins CI/CD 

### Continuous Integration (CI)
In the realm of Continuous Integration (CI), Jenkins simplifies the process by cloning the code, packaging it, and running tests to ensure its integrity.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
Following successful CI, we delve into Continuous Delivery (CD), where we verify your authentication and thoroughly assess the system's readiness. Once confirmed, we proceed to deploy the code, effectively delivering it to the system.

### Key Differences Between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Delivery:** After CI, a manual action is required to trigger the deployment process. You have control over when the code is delivered to the system.

**Continuous Deployment:** This approach is entirely automatic. Human intervention is eliminated. If code is pushed to GitHub at any time, including two o'clock in the afternoon, it will automatically be deployed to your system.
