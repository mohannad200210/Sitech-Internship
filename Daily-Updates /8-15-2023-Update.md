**AWS**

what i learned are :
- EC2 Hibernate
- EBS
- EBS Snapshots

and this is my POC :


1-Enable Hibernate when creat new EC2 instance

2-Creat a new EBS volume and attach it to running EC2 instance so now the EC2 instance have 2 EBS volumes attached to it

3-Creat snapshot from EBS volume

4-Creat Retention Rule to restore snapshots from recycle bin using it

**Docker**

what i learned are :

-Publishing Ports  

-Logging Drivers

-Troubleshoot Docker Daemon 


**Here is my POC**



by default the logs stores as json file in : 
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ sudo ls /var/lib/docker/containers/1b5a2b3bc0f5af53ff78ab23e4cfc7f7c5a77c787537a8ac51318035f313a921
1b5a2b3bc0f5af53ff78ab23e4cfc7f7c5a77c787537a8ac51318035f313a921-json.log
```
you can find  the current way of the logs driver by : 
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker system info | grep -i logging
 Logging Driver: json-file
```
you can change the logging type in docker : 
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ gedit /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "log-driver": "syslog"
}
systemctl restart docker
```
you can change the logs type only for one container using option : --log-driver=syslog
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker run â€“d --log-driver=syslog nginx
```

most basic port mapping : 
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker container run -p 8000:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp
 This is a sample web application that displays a colored background. 
 A color can be specified in two ways. 

 1. As a command line argument with --color as the argument. Accepts one of red,green,blue,blue2,pink,darkblue 
 2. As an Environment variable APP_COLOR. Accepts one of red,green,blue,blue2,pink,darkblue 
 3. If none of the above then a random color is picked from the above list. 
 Note: Command line argument precedes over environment variable.


No command line argument or environment variable. Picking a Random Color =pink

 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```
you can specify one network interface if you have multiple NIC by using it's IP:
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker container run -p 192.168.203.136:8000:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp

```
you can only specify the internal port and docker will chose random external port from /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range 
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker container run -p 5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp

```
importaaaant : if you have multiple internal port in your docker container and you want to maps it ALL using one command use -P option(-p : static port not change after restart -P: random dynamic port change after restart)
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker container run -P kodekloud/simple-webapp

```
and you can see all the container internal ports using "docker inspect [container name OR id]" in the expose field
```
escanor@escanor-virtual-machine:~/Desktop$ docker container inspect 37ae8903b0dcf02 | grep -in4 expose
139-            "User": "",
140-            "AttachStdin": false,
141-            "AttachStdout": false,
142-            "AttachStderr": false,
143:            "ExposedPorts": {
144-                "8080/tcp": {}
145-            },
146-            "Tty": false,
147-            "OpenStdin": false,

```
