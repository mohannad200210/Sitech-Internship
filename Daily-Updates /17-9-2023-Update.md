## Yesterday, Since I didn't quite understand the final task in Jenkins and i did it in the wrong way last week, so I tried to do it again but got stuck when I was trying to set up the Tomcat server with Docker.

- First, I tried to use the official Tomcat docker image, but it didn't work.

- After spending a lot of time trying to fix it, I tried to using an unofficial Tomcat image, and that finally made it work.

- But when I tried to access the [admin/manager] page, it said I didn't have permission (403 status code).

- I also tried to edit /conf/tomcat-users.xml file as the image above said , but my changes didn't seem to do anything.

  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
  to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
  you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

  Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
    - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
    - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
    - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
    - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

  The users below are wrapped in a comment and are therefore ignored. If you
  wish to configure one or more of these users for use with the manager web
  application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds them. You
  will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
-->

  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="robot" password="robot" roles="manager-script"/>
```

- 
- I will keep working on resolving that issue, and once it's fixed, I will proceed to properly reconfigure the remaining parts of the task in the right way
