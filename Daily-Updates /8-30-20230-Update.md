### Yesterday i focused on the AWS and what i learned are :
- DNS  Overview

- Route 53 Overview

- Route 53 - TTL

- CNAME record type
 
- Alias record type

-  Routing Policy - Simple

-  Routing Policy - Weighted

- Routing Policy - Latency

- Route 53 - Health Checks


## Since Route 53 is not included in the AWS free tier, I didn't apply the above concepts. As a result, there is no POC. However, I have prepared a summary of what I have learned.



- DNS Overview:
Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that translates domain names into IP addresses .

- Route 53 Overview:
Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service provided by AWS, offering domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

- Route 53 - TTL:
Time to Live (TTL) is a setting in Route 53 that determines how long DNS records are cached by resolvers. It affects how quickly changes to DNS records propagate across the internet.

- CNAME Record Type:
The CNAME record type in Route 53 is used to create an Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com) (ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN) .

- Alias Record Type:
The Alias record type in Route 53 allows you to map your domain name to AWS resources directly, like an Amazon S3 bucket or an Elastic Load Balancer,  Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com).

- Routing Policy - Simple:
The Simple routing policy in Route 53 directs traffic to a single resource, such as an IP address or a domain name. It's suitable when you have only one resource to handle requests.

- Routing Policy - Weighted:
Weighted routing policy in Route 53 distributes traffic across different resources based on assigned weights. This is useful for load balancing traffic across multiple instances.

- Routing Policy - Latency:
The Latency routing policy directs traffic to the AWS region that provides the lowest latency for the user, optimizing response times for improved performance.

- Route 53 - Health Checks:
Route 53's health checks monitor the health of resources, such as web servers, and automatically route traffic away from unhealthy resources, enhancing the availability of your applications.
